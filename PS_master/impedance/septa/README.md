# Impedance of septa

The septa moslty have an reactive component that can contribute to loss of
Landau damping. The septa are important contributors in terms of inductive
ImZ/n (where $`n=f/f_\mathrm{rev}`$, for the plots $`f_\mathrm{rev}=477`$ kHz is assumed).

Some small low frequency resonances were measured with wire measurements and should be
analyzed.

Presently, only SMH42 is included an the other elements should be evaluated.
 
The list of septa installed in the PS is the following:

- TPS15: Dummy septum for protection of SMH16 (added during LS1)
- SMH16: extraction to SPS
- SEH23: fast extraction to East Hall
- SMH26: ion injection from LEIR
- SEH31: CT extraction to SPS (removed during LS2, see [ECR](https://edms.cern.ch/ui/file/1981131/0.1/PS-LJ-EC-0007-00-10.pdf))
- SMH42: injection of proton beam from PSB
- SMH57: slow extraction to East Hall
- SMH61: slow extraction to East Hall
