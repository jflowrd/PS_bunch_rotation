# Impedance of PS 195 vacuum flange

The PS 195 vacuum flange is the most common flange in the PS with 179/259 elements.

The model includes the gap and assumes the nominal elliptic beam pipes around
the flange.

Following \[1\], the gap length in the flange is of 4.5mm (2.5mm due to the
gasket +2mm step). 

A better survey of the vacuum flanges is required and this model is mostly
used to have an order of magnitude of the overall impedance budget of
the flanges in the PS

## Subfolders and usage

- CST Raw Data

Both wakefields and eigenmodes were simulated. The beam pipe and flange
are assumed to be made of stainless steel.
