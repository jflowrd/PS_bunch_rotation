# Impedance of rf cavities

The list of cavities and their function is the following:

- C10 (2.8-10 MHz, 10 cavities + 1 spare): accelerating system and rf manipulations (batch compression, bunch merging and splitting)
- C20 (13.3-20 MHz, 1 cavity + 1 spare): rf manipulations (bunch splitting of proton beam, batch compression of ion beam)
- C40 (40 MHz, 2 cavities): rf manipulations (bunch splitting, bunch compression of proton beam)
- C80 (80 MHz, 3 cavities): rf manipulations (bunch compression of proton and ion beam)
- C200 (200 MHz, 6 cavities): controlled emittance blow-up, prebunching of debunched beam for extraction to SPS
- Finemet (0.4-5 MHz, 1 cavity): longitudinal dipolar coupled-bunch feedback
