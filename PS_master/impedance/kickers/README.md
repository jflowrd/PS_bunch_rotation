# Impedance of kickers

The kickers are an important contribution to the overall PS impedance.

The kickers moslty have broadband component and are expected to produce
energy loss through the resistive impedance with short bunches and loss of
Landau damping through the reactive impedance. The kickers are the main
contributors in terms of inductive ImZ/n (where $`n=f/f_\mathrm{rev}`$,
for the plots $`f_\mathrm{rev}=477`$ kHz is assumed).

The connection of the kickers to the power supplies can also be responsible
of low frequency resonances, which should not be neglected.

The list of kickers installed in the PS is the following:

- BFA09: CT extraction (BFA09S disconnected during LS2)
- BFA21: CT extraction (removed during LS2)
- KFA04: MTE extraction
- KFA13: MTE extraction
- KFA21: MTE extraction
- KFA28: ions injection
- KFA45: protons injection (upgraded during LS2)
- KFA71: fast extraction kicker
- KFA79: fast extraction kicker
