# Impedance of Beam Instrumentation

The impedance of beam instrumentation devices used to measure the beam
characteristics.

These devices are mostly responsible for high frequency resonances.
Since these are single devices, the impedance is usually small in comparison
to the other impedance sources.

The listing of equipment is:

- Wire Scanners (sections 54, 64, 75, 85)
- Wall Current Monitors (section 03)
- Stripline BPM (section 72)
- Pick-ups in assemblies downstream of the main Magnet Units are located in the [vacuum folder](https://longitudinal-impedance.web.cern.ch/PS/vacuum/) (insertion in pumping manifolds)
- **Missing equipment to be listed**
